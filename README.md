## Getting started

You need to have `Node.js` installed beforehand.

First, clone the repository by

```
git clone https://github.com/mikelovesolivia/react-personal-portfolio-template.git
```

Then go to the project folder and install the required JavaScript packages by

```
npm install
```

Finally, you can start the project by running

```
npm start
```

And you will see it run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Folder structure

- `./public` stores publicly accessible contents (images, videos, etc.). 
- `./src` stores the source code of the project.
  - `./src/pages` stores all pages `(.jsx)` and the corresponding style sheet `styles.css`.
  - `./src/components` stores all components `(.jsx)` used for the pages and the corresponding style sheet `components.css`.
  - `./src/data` stores all data for the project. Each data file `(.js)` corresponds to a page with the related name.


## Customize

- Prepare your data 
  - If you want to add new files and show them on your customized dataset, you can just store them in the `./public` folder. When you need to provide the address for that file, you only need to provide the path relative to `./public`.
  - For example, as to an image stored in `./public/images/image.png`, you only need to refer it as `./images/image.png` as its path.

- Customize your content
  - Modify the data files `(.js)` following the example code and comment instructions.

- Make your blog
  - If you do not want a blog, you can remove `line 59 ~ 65` to disable the blog section:
  ```jsx
  <Nav.Link 
    href="https://mikelovesolivia.github.io/react-personal-portfolio-template/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    Blog
  </Nav.Link>
  ```
  - If you have your own blog already, just change the link above to yours.
  - If you do not have a blog but want to have one, you can build it with [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). You can follow this [tutorial](https://hexo.io/docs/). For the theme, I used [Keep](https://github.com/XPoet/hexo-theme-keep?tab=readme-ov-file) for my [blog](https://mikelovesolivia.github.io/blog/) and it offers very detailed [documents](https://keep-docs.xpoet.cn/). You can also pick your favorite one on [Hexo Themes](https://hexo.io/themes/).

- Track your visitors
  - This project uses [RevolverMaps](https://www.revolvermaps.com/) to track and record vistor statistics. If you want to customize your own visitor statistics widget, change `script.src` in `line 8` of `./src/components/VisitorMap.jsx` to the link of your selected widget's.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

Deployment is done following this [Doc](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages):
- Go to `package.json` and change the URL of `"homepage"` in `line 5`

  ```"homepage": "https://mikelovesolivia.github.io/react-personal-portfolio-template/"```

  into your GitHub address 
  
  ```"https://{your_github_username}.github.io/{your_repo_name}/"```

- Install the `gh-pages` package 

  ```
  npm install gh-pages --save-dev
  ```

- Initialize `git`

  ```
  git init
  ```

- Add a remote GitHub repo to the local Git repo
  
  ```
  git remote add origin https://github.com/{your_github_username}/{your_repo_name}.git
  ```

- Finally you can deploy by

  ```
  npm run deploy
  ``` 
  
  and you will find it in your `gh-pages` branch.
- If you haven't made a GitHub Page for your repo, please go to `Settings/Pages` and change the `branch` under `Build and deployment` from `main` (or other branches) to `gh-pages`. (Follow this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) for more details.) You will see the change in few minutes.
